## Expected learning outcomes
The purpose of this course is to gain a fluent command of the JavaScript programming language regardless of the environment, i.e. browser or node. In particular, participants will obtain a conceptual understanding of how to solve real-life problems using JavaScript such as creating a REST API, manipulating data, consuming APIs, and parsing data.

## Assessment of learning outcomes
Participants are encouraged to find a study partner and be resourceful throughout their participation in this course. Formal assessment will be administered through minor section assignments, major section checkpoints, and a cumulative final exam. Grades will be stored in the [Gradebook](./Gradebook.md) and will be updated with each turned in assignment, regrade, etc.

## Turning in assignments
When working on an assignment, create a new branch from an **up-to-date** master branch. When the assignment is complete, make a pull request from your assignment branch to the master branch. I will use your pull request to grade the assignment.

## Late work and regrades
5 points will be deducted for each day an assignment is late, up to 40 points at which point a grade of 0 will be recorded for the assignment. 2 points will be deducted for each time an assignment is re-graded.

## Minor section assignments
The term minor section refers to a second-level list item on this syllabus under ["Material Covered"](#material-covered), e.g. `Consuming Promises`. Minor section assignments are assigned on Thursdays and are due the following Wednesday at 11 PM.

## Major section checkpoint
The term major section refers to a first-level list item on this syllabus under ["Material Covered"](#material-covered), e.g. `Functions`. Major section checkpoint follow the same schedule as minor section assignments, i.e. they are assigned on Thursdays and are due the following Wednesday at 11 PM. However, major section checkpoint are cumulative to the entire major section.

## Cumulative final
A cumulative final exam will be administered on an agreed-upon date. The final will require a comprehensive understanding of all material covered in this course.

## Course grade
Grading for the course will be performed as follows:  
30% - Minor section assignments  
30% - Major section checkpoints  
40% - Final exam  

The lowest grade on one minor section assignment and one major section checkpoint will be dropped.
